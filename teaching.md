## Courses and workshops

- Advanced computational methods in geotechnical engineering (2017, 2019) covering state of the art numerical tools.
- Constitutive modelling in geomechanics with emphasis on porous media behaviour.
- Guest lectures on finite element and finite difference methods for engineering applications.

## Educational codes and resources

- Finite difference method examples for one dimensional consolidation.
- Finite difference method examples for steady state flow in two dimensions.
- Streamlit apps and notebooks that pair teaching material with interactive simulations.

## Supervision and mentoring

- MSc and PhD supervision on computational geomechanics topics at NTNU and partner institutions.
- Undergraduate mentoring on engineering mechanics, structures, and CAD workflows.
- Industry workshops that translate research code into practical training material.

More structured notes and teaching materials will be added here as they are published.
