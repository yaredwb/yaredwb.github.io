Pictures tell a story way better than words. And in the language of nature which is mathematics, words are often too few. Finding easier ways to explain abstract math concepts can be very helpful. There are a lot of visual illustrations for math concepts or proofs, which range from simple to very abstract, that make the ideas easier to understand. Here are some I collected, mostly from elementary mathematics.

What is the circumference of a circle with a unit diameter? Well, you can use the well known equation $latex \pi*D $ and say it is $latex \pi$. Or you can take a look at this gif.

You can try to prove that for a polygon with $latex n$ sides. The proof without words is shown here.

But what is a radian really? What does 1 rad mean, without looking at its equivalent in degrees? That is illustrated here.

Simple but smart!

There is a theorem that says the sum of the first $latex n$ odd numbers is equal to $latex n^2$. How would you prove that? Here is how. And that is way easier than <a title="Odd number theorem" href="http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Odd_Number_Theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>. Note that this one is not animated.

There are also some <a title="Proofs without Words" href="http://www.amazon.com/Proofs-without-Words-Exercises-Classroom/dp/0883857006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a>s on this topic. Enjoy!
