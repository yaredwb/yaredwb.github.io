Google has gone a long way in its quest to [digitize every book on the planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books_Library_Project), despite [pushback](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/technology/internet/02link.html) from publishers and authors. One fun side effect of this enormous effort is Google's n-gram viewer, which lets you explore how often particular words appear in books over time. Type `define <your word>` into Google and expand the graph at the top of the results; most charts stretch back to at least 1800.

Here are a few word trends that caught my eye. The drop in "curiosity" made me wonder whether the cat really did scare us off. "Amharic" swings wildly, while "injera" gently climbs. There is some culinary pride in there!
