Some of my favorite reads span memoir, business, science, and fiction. A few that I keep returning to:

- *Tuesdays with Morrie*: Mitch Albom's gentle reminder about what really matters.
- *Screw It, Let's Do It*: Richard Branson's punchy take on entrepreneurship.
- *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*: Stephen Covey's classic on personal leadership.
- *Six Thinking Hats*: Edward de Bono's framework for creative problem solving.
- *Digital Fortress*: Dan Brown's thriller for the cryptography-inclined.
- *The Prophet*: Kahlil Gibran's poetic reflections on life.
- *A Brief History of Time*: Stephen Hawking's guided tour of the universe.
- *Thinking, Fast and Slow*: Daniel Kahneman on the quirks of our decision-making.
- *Animal Farm*: George Orwell's sharp political satire that still resonates.
