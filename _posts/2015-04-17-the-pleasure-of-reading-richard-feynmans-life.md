I recently finished reading the autobiography of one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, Richard Feynman, entitled [*Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!). My feeling from beginning to end was, "why was I so late to read it?" It is undoubtedly one of the best books I have read. The stories take you close to the scientific and personal journey of this Nobel Prize winning physicist, who somehow also found time for art, biology, safe-cracking, bongo playing, and endless curiosity.

Feynman repeatedly mentions the influence of his father on his approach to life and science. His anecdotes show a life lived with humour, integrity, and a willingness to ask "why?" about everything. I jotted down a few passages that resonated with me:

> *You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like what they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.*

> *The individual member of the social community often receives his information via visual, symbolic channels. I went back and forth over it, and translated. You know what it means? People read.*

> *So I have just one wish for you - the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom.*

> *You see, I get so much fun out of thinking that I don't want to destroy this pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick.*

Fascinated by his story in the book, I went hunting for more. The BBC series **Fun to Imagine** is a brilliant example of Feynman explaining everyday phenomena with infectious enthusiasm. His description of fire is still my favourite.

For longer dives, [*The Fantastic Mr. Feynman*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyqleIxXTpw) documentary and [*The Pleasure of Finding Things Out*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pleasure_of_Finding_Things_Out) interview collection are excellent companions.
