title: "The Pleasure of Reading Richard Feynman's Life"
---

I recently finished reading the autobiography of one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, Richard Feynman, entitled <a title="Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman</a>. My feeling from beginning to end was 'why was I so late to read it?' It was undoubtedly one of the best books I have read. It was fascinating to look closer into the scientific and personal journey of this Nobel Prize winning physicist. He narrates several amazing stories. Even though he was&nbsp;a theoretical physicist, he developed many other interests like in art (drawing/painting), biology and bongo playing. &nbsp;The way he lived his life made a striking impression on me. You observe&nbsp;from his captivating stories that he lived life the way he saw it - always passionately curious and fun loving. Feynman repeatedly mentions the influence of his father on the way he lived his life and what he became later. It was a great read. I&nbsp;encourage anyone to read the book. I share here some excerpts&nbsp;that I found especially interesting:

When he was offered a top scientific position by the Institute for Advanced Study, he emphasizes that he does what he does not to fulfill people's expectations but for the pleasure of it:
<p style="text-align: right;">"...&nbsp;<em>You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like what they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing</em>. ..."</p>
While attending a social science conference and reading a paper written by one sociologist:
<p style="text-align: right;">"... <em>“The individual member of the social community often receives his information via visual, symbolic channels.” I went back and forth over it, and translated. You know what it means? “People read.”</em> ..."</p>
He said he would never participate in such conferences. :-)

Reciting a lecture he gave on science and society:
<p style="text-align: right;">"<em>... So I have just one wish for you – the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom. ...</em>"</p>
About being drank and participating in hallucination experiments:
<p style="text-align: right;">"... <em>You see, I get so much fun out of thinking that I don’t want to destroy this pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick.</em> ..."</p>
Well, you wouldn't have much to read if I share everything here. :-)

Fascinated by his story in the book, I expanded my research online and came across several of his lectures and documentaries about his life. The BBC series entitled Fun to Imagine&nbsp;was particularly interesting, which can be found on YouTube. In this series, Feynman explains various day to day phenomena and materials from a point of view you probably have never heard of. The way he explained fire scientifically, and simply, in this video was incredible:

I am never going to look at fire in the same way I did. You could also see the pleasure he gets from understanding nature and explaining it to people.
