There is a logic puzzle that is claimed to have been written by Albert Einstein when he was a boy, even though there is no tangible evidence for that. There are many versions with the same idea. Here is one of them.

**The Puzzle**

There are five houses in five different colors arranged in a row. Each house is occupied by a person of a different nationality. The five owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No two owners share the same pet, cigar brand, or drink.

Additional information:

- The Brit lives in the red house.
- The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
- The Dane drinks tea.
- The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.
- The owner of the green house drinks coffee.
- The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
- The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
- The owner of the centre house drinks milk.
- The Norwegian lives in the first house.
- The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
- The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
- The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
- The German smokes Prince.
- The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
- The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.

The question: **Who owns the fish?**

Give it a try without cheating. :-)
