There is a logic puzzle which is claimed to have been written by Albert Einstein when he was a boy, even though there is no tangible evidence for that. There are different versions of the puzzle with the same idea. Here is one:
**The Puzzle**
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage.
Additional info:
 	- The Brit lives in the red house.
 	- The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
 	- The Dane drinks tea.
 	- The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
 	- The green house's owner drinks coffee.
 	- The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
 	- The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
 	- The owner living in the center house drinks milk.
 	- The Norwegian lives in the first house.
 	- The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.
 	- The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
 	- The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer.
 	- The German smokes Prince.
 	- The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
 	- The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water.
The question is: WHO OWNS THE FISH?
Try and solve that without cheating. :-)
