title: "Einstein's Riddle"
---

There&nbsp;is a logic puzzle which is claimed to have been written by Albert Einstein when he was a boy, even though there is no tangible evidence for that. There are different versions of the puzzle with the same idea. Here is one:

<strong>The Puzzle</strong>

There are 5 houses in 5 different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage.
