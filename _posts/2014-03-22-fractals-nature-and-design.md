Fractals are fascinating. A [fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) is a self-repeating pattern that looks the same at every magnification. Mathematicians have studied them for decades; books such as [*The Fractal Geometry of Nature*](http://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Geometry-Nature-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0716711869) and [*Fractals Everywhere*](http://www.amazon.com/Fractals-Everywhere-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486488705/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1395481868&sr=1-1&keywords=fractals+everywhere) dig deep into the theory. Once you start looking, it is easy to spot fractal-like structures all around us.

There is a [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_eglash_on_african_fractals) that highlights African fractal designs, and the speaker kindly shared an interactive tool [online](http://csdt.rpi.edu/african/African_Fractals/background5.html). I borrowed a few examples below.

**Fern** - this fern leaf grows from a simple shape of four line segments, repeated again and again.

**Ethiopian Cross** - proof that our ancestors had an eye for recursive detail.

**Algae** - much like the fern, a surprisingly complex shape emerges from a simple starting pattern.

Nature is full of these repeating patterns: lightning, broccoli, lungs, seashells, peacocks, pineapples, crystals, trees, and more. Once you notice them, you cannot help but keep exploring.
