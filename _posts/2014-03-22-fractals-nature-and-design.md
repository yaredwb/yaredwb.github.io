title: "Fractals, Nature and Design"

Fractals are fascinating. A <a title="Fractal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fractal</a> is a self-repeating pattern of some sort which appears exactly the same at all magnification levels. Mathematicians are especially interested in fractals and have studied them over a long period of time. Several books have been written on fractals, for instance <a title="The Fractal Geometry of Nature" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Geometry-Nature-Benoit-Mandelbrot/dp/0716711869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fractal Geometry of Nature</a> and <a title="Fractals Everywhere" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fractals-Everywhere-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486488705/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1395481868&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fractals+everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fractals Everywhere</a>. Looking closely at nature, we see that there are many things which have a self-similar or self-repeating pattern, which makes them fractals.

There is a <a title="Ron Eglash - African Fractals" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_eglash_on_african_fractals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED talk</a> about fractals and the speaker has generously made his tool available online <a title="Fractal generator" href="http://csdt.rpi.edu/african/African_Fractals/background5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, where you can play with existing fractal iterations or create your own from scratch. I borrowed some of them here.

<strong>Fern</strong>: This one shows how a fern leaf can develop from a simple shape of four line segments. Notice how the basic shape repeats itself.

<strong>Ethiopian Cross</strong>: Did our ancient fathers know about fractals?

<strong>Algae</strong>: In a similar way to the fern, a complicated object arises from a simple shape.

Many other things in nature, such as lightning, broccoli, human lungs, sea shells, peacock, pineapple, crystals, trees, exhibit a fractal. Captivating designs! Enjoy exploring.
