They say mainstream technology lags 25 years behind what the labs are experimenting with. There is some truth to that when you look at how today's breakthroughs began as research projects decades ago. The pace keeps accelerating; some inventions become obsolete before they even reach every corner of the world. ([HD DVD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_DVD) bowed out before it had a real chance to spread across Africa, for instance.)

That rapid turnover makes it fun to compare "cutting edge" gadgets with the clunky tools they replaced. It also makes you wonder which of today's essentials will make us chuckle in a decade or two.

### The evolution of the hard drive

The 28 MB IBM 1301 Disk Storage Unit from 1961 versus a 1 TB Kingston HyperX Predator flash drive from 2013 says it all.

### Mobile phones then and now

From the brick that kicked things off to the supercomputer in your pocket.

### Wires, wires everywhere

Networking, telecommunications, and power distribution still lean heavily on cables. Laying fibre optic lines across oceans is no small feat, and wireless power never quite recovered after [Nikola Tesla's](http://www.teslasociety.com/tesla_tower.htm) passing. It feels like there must be a tidier solution waiting in the wings.

### Batteries

Imagine explaining to someone from 2050 that we had to recharge our phones every day. Solving energy storage is a multi-billion-dollar opportunity for whoever finally cracks it.

### Supercomputers?

Today's supercomputers are warehouse-sized collections of processors that need elaborate cooling. Tomorrow's machines will make them look prehistoric. Until then, marvel at systems like the Titan.

### Transportation

Airplanes and high-speed trains have already shrunk the planet, but there is more to come. The [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde) once slashed the London-New York trip in half, and concepts like the [Hyperloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop) hint at what is next. Someday we will laugh at spending 15 hours in the air.

More to follow! In the meantime, here is a site that loves predicting what is next: [**Future Timeline**](http://www.futuretimeline.net/index.htm).
