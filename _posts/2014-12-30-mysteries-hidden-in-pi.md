The ever increasing power of computers has enabled mathematicians to calculate $latex \pi$ to several decimal places. The current record stands at 13.3 trillion digits (as of October 8, 2014) and the computation took 208 days. Look [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_computation_of_%CF%80) for a&nbsp;chronological list of the record computations. Then comes the inevitable question: why are so many mathematicians obsessed with this irrational number? What is the need for calculating so many digits of $latex \pi$? Some do it just for fun while others have very good reasons. The reasons could be for&nbsp;varying purposes such as to test an algorithm or to prove one's own conjecture, or a conjecture made by someone else.

The form of $latex \pi$ that is particularly interesting to many is its&nbsp;binary form. Binary is the fundamental language of computers where everything is represented by a bunch of 0s and 1s. In binary form, the&nbsp;$latex \pi$ we know as
```

would look something like
```

1100010011000110011000101000101110000000110111000001110011010001...
```
Every digital content whether it is music, picture, movie, software, webpage etc. is stored on a computer in binary form. The conjecture here is that we can find anything we can imagine in the binary form of $latex \pi$ since the digits are random and infinite. Let's rephrase that: you can find anything that has ever existed, exists or will exist if you look far enough in the binary digits of $latex \pi$. A small&nbsp;video that explains this:

So, how do you find something in there? That is by no means an easy task. It would require a sophisticated algorithm and a powerful computer, to say the least. Another way is to surprise yourself by picking out a bunch of random binary digits and converting them to text, audio or video. &nbsp;Here is one attempt of that: [Finding stuff in binary $latex \pi$](http://www.befria.nu/elias/pi/index.html).

A slightly different approach to exploring this irrational number is a [random walk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk)&nbsp;either on its binary form or any other base $latex n$ form. Here is the result from a random walk on the first 100 billion digits of $latex \pi$ represented in base 4 i.e. in the form of 0s, 1s, 2s and 3s: (Click the picture for interactive content).

The result somewhat supports the hypothesis that the digits of $latex \pi$ are random. It seems certain that we will hear several findings in the future. For now, we remain with the idea as a conjecture.

I found my birthday and my phone number somewhere in the&nbsp;digits of $latex \pi$. See if you can find yours [here](http://www.exploratorium.edu/pi/pi_archive/Pi10-6.html)&nbsp;(1 million digits) or [here](http://pi.karmona.com/) (10 million digits). Go [here](http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery) if you want to find out the exact locations and how many times those numbers appear within the first 200 million digits of $latex \pi$.
