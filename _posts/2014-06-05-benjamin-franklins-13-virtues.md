After recently reading [*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin*](http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Benjamin-Franklin-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486290735), I wanted to share something that made him one of the most notable people who walked on our earth. He came up with his famous 13 virtues in what he called "a bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection." The virtues and their precepts seem ordinary at first glance, yet his method was to focus on one at a time until it became a habit.

Here are the virtues in Franklin's own words:

- **Temperance** - "Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation."
- **Order** - "Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time."
- **Resolution** - "Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve."
- **Frugality** - "Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing."
- **Moderation** - "Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve."
- **Industry** - "Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions."
- **Cleanliness** - "Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation."
- **Tranquility** - "Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable."
- **Silence** - "Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation."
- **Sincerity** - "Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly."
- **Justice** - "Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty."
- **Chastity** - "Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation."
- **Humility** - "Imitate Jesus and Socrates."

As with all advice worth hearing, take what you will!
