## Main interests

- **Computational Modeling**: Applying advanced numerical methods in various application areas in computational science and engineering, mainly for coupled problems in geomechanics/poromechanics
- **Numerical Programming** - Developing codes for professional research and hobby projects mainly based on Python and C++
- **Machine Learning** - Exploring the possibilities of applying machine learning in geomechanics, particularly towards improving speed and accuracy in computational modelling problems
- **Data Analysis and Visualization** - Applying modern data analysis and visualisation tools and methods to engineering data for a better insight and content creation
- **Academics** - Teaching and supervision. Giving lectures, particularly on computational modeling courses, and supervising/co-supervising undergraduate and graduate students
