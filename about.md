## Welcome

Welcome to my website. Look around to learn more about me and my professional and personal interests. You will find my resume, a portfolio of my professional and hobby research activities, teaching and supervision assignments I have undertaken and blog posts where I write about topics that are of interest to me.

A little bit personal info about me: I was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. After studying my BSc in Civil Engineering back home, I moved to Norway to pursue my graduate studies. I have been living, studying and working in Norway since then.
