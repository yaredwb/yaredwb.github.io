## Welcome

Welcome to my website. Look around to learn more about me and my professional and personal interests. You will find my resume, a portfolio of my professional and hobby research activities, teaching and supervision assignments I have undertaken and blog posts where I write about topics that are of interest to me.

A little bit personal info about me: I was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. After studying my BSc in Civil Engineering back home, I moved to Norway to pursue my graduate studies. I have been living, studying and working in Norway since then.

### Main Interests and Competence

- **Machine Learning and AI**: Developing machine learning models and generative AI assistants in geomechanics, particularly towards improving speed and accuracy for practical computational modelling problems

- **Computational Modeling**: Applying advanced numerical methods in various application areas in computational science and engineering, mainly for coupled problems in geomechanics/poromechanics

- **Numerical Programming**: Developing codes for professional research and hobby projects mainly based on Python and C++

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Applying modern data analysis and visualisation tools and methods to engineering data for better insight and content creation

- **Teaching and Supervision**: Giving lectures, particularly on computational modeling courses, and supervising/co-supervising undergraduate and graduate students
